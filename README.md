## Get-SNV-info
 
Got an interesting mutation/variant? Want to know what other info about it is out there? Then check out these databases!


## [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/)
Get rsID and population frequenices.

## [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)
Check if your variant is already associated with a disease. It "aggregates information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health."

## [COSMIC](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic)
The Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer. Search for somatic mutations found in cancer.


## [OMIM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim)
An "authoritative compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes". 

## [GTEx](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/)
Does your variant influence the expression levels of a gene? Here you can check the correlation between genotypes and tissue-specific levels of gene expression. 

## [HGMD](http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php)
Human Gene Mutation Database.

## Conservation
Check if your variant is located in a conserved region. Conserved regions are more likely to be biologically functional. Use GERP and  phyloP scores.
